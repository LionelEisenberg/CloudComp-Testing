# CloudComp-Testing

This is the testing repository for Cloud Computing project (Spring 2019). We will use more code to work on this repository and test it.

## Contents

This repository is a dummy repository that is used by our project in order to test, design and implement our core project: Testing over multiple commits.

The code here will be a collection of sorting algorithms, if you see many - or rather superfluous - commits, that is to further test our application.

### Commit landmarks

#### Commit #22

Functional version of the program, all of our sorting algorithms work: the program works with commend line arguments:

    1. Specific sorting function (insertion, selection, and bubble).
    2. Filename with non sorted intergers, one per line, to be sorted.
